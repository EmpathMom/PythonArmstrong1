#this project took me far to long to complete and understand being 35 and out of school for years 
I definatly took my time understanding the inner workings of the Armstrong method. finally got it pushed into GitHub at 12 am and its finally time to rest.
I have been working on this since 4 pm. somwtimes when you get stuck phone a friend and have them listen to you. it will eventually pan out.


UPDATE 2.0

unfortunately, i had tyo try to get it pushed throught while i was working.
